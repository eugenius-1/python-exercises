# python-exercises
 A collection of exercises and challenges designed to demonstrate the ability to tackle a variety of algorithmic, logical, and computational problems.

 ### What's Inside?

The challenges range from classic **algorithmic problems** to tasks involving data manipulation and string processing. Examples of these problems include:

* **Sudoku Solver**: A classic backtracking problem that demonstrates a grasp of complex recursion and logical constraints.
* **Shortest Path Algorithm**: An essential graph theory problem that showcases an understanding of traversal algorithms like Dijkstra's or Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the most efficient route between two nodes.
* **Luhn's Algorithm**: A practical exercise in number theory and modular arithmetic, showcasing an understanding of real-world data validation.
* **Caesar's Cipher**: A perfect introduction to cryptography, focusing on string manipulation and basic encryption techniques.
* **Additional Challenges**: The repository is continuously growing with new problems that cover topics like sorting, searching, and data structures.

Each challenge is housed in its own dedicated directory and the solutions are designed to be readable and efficient.
